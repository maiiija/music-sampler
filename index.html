        Brian Eno (b. 1948) started his career as an art rock musician, similar to David Bowie and other contemporaries, with a focus on electronic instruments. His first solo album, <i>Here Come the Warm Jets</i>, was released in 1974 and primarily featured this sound. 1975's <i>Another Green World</i>, one of his most popular albums, featured a mix of art rock and ambient music, marking his transition into the genre he has been most known for. His most well-known ambient work, and most well-known work in general, was <i>Ambient 1: Music for Airports</i>. He is said to have created the ambient genre. Another of his more popular ambient works is <i>Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks</i>. This album was made as a soundtrack for the documentary film <i>For All Mankind</i>, which was not released until 1989. "An Ending (Ascent)," the most popular track from the album, has been used in a variety of other films and TV shows.
